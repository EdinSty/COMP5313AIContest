# COMP5313 AI Contest Group #2



This repository contains solutions to three challenging problems from the **USACO 2024 US Open Contest** (Platinum Division), implemented using **ChatGPT** and **AgentGPT** for problem-solving and code generation. The problems are solved using Jupyter notebooks, demonstrating a combination of AI-based assistance, algorithmic thinking, and efficient coding practices.

## Problems Covered

### 1. **Identity Theft**
In this problem, we focus on detecting **duplicate identities** or **mismatched data** in a given set of records. The goal is to validate the uniqueness of user IDs or other identifiers, ensuring no repetition unless explicitly allowed. Efficient data structures like **hash sets** and **hash maps** were used to track and identify duplicates, optimizing the solution for large datasets.

### 2. **Splitting Haybales**
This problem involves dividing a set of haybales into subsets such that certain conditions (such as total weight) are met. The solution utilizes a combination of sorting, binary search, and dynamic programming. Efficient algorithms were employed to ensure the problem is solved within the time constraints for large inputs.

### 3. **Activating Robots**
This problem asks to assign unique **IDs** to robots and check for any **duplicate IDs**. The solution ensures that each robot has a distinct identifier, and any conflicts or repetitions are detected and handled. **Set** data structures were used to track active robots and check for duplicate identifiers, ensuring the system operates correctly without activation errors.
